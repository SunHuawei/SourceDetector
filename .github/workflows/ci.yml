The complete list of files we can't accept are:\n- ${badFiles}\n\nYou'll need to revert all of the files you changed in that list using [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-commits/reverting-a-commit) or \`git checkout origin/main <file name>\`. Once you get those files reverted, we can continue with the review process. :octocat:\n\nMore discussion:\n- https://github.com/electron-vite/electron-vite-vue/issues/192`
